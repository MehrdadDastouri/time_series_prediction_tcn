# Time Series Prediction with Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN)

This project demonstrates how to use Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN) for time series forecasting. TCN is a powerful architecture for modeling sequential data, offering strong performance in a variety of time-dependent tasks.

## Features
- **Dataset**: Synthetic sine wave with noise.
- **Model**: Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) with causal and dilated convolutions.
- **Application**: Predict future time steps based on historical data.
- **Visualization**: Predicted vs actual future values.
